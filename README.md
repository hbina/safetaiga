Serves as an REST(hopefully) endpoints for YAAPOS. Which is a tool that allows you to track how much you have spent over a lifetime, as when you start using it. The idea behind YAAPOS is to track money spent on a daily basis, removing all other factors like when your money comes in, when you pay the rent etc etc. The only indicator that you should care about is $/day. This way, I believe, you will spend less on the day you receive your paycheck because your daily usage is all that matters.
